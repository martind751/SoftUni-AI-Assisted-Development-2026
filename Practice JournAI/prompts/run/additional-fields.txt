Extend the practice sessions with these additional fields: duration in minutes, energy level from 1 to 5, multiple notes, each note to have timestamp as well, and a status (planned, completed, or skipped). Each session also has a genre field, but users don't pick it manually — it's automatically set based on which genre layout they're currently using on the frontend (Jazz, Blues, or Rock/Metal). Make the get-all endpoint filterable by genre and status so the frontend only shows sessions that belong to the active layout.
