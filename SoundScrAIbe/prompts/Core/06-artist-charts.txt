Plan how to implement the artist-charts module. Before writing any code, check the current Spotify Web API docs to find the appropriate endpoints for this feature — the app is in Dev Mode under the February 2026 restrictions, so verify availability. Build the necessary backend endpoints and a frontend Artist Charts page with interactive charts (use Recharts) showing listening patterns by artist. Include at least play count and listening time views. Charts should be responsive with tooltips. Add a loading state and link the page in the nav.
