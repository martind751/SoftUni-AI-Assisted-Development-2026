Plan the implementation of the auth module. The app uses Spotify OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow the frontend initiates login by redirecting to Spotify's authorize endpoint with a code_verifier/code_challenge, then Spotify redirects back with an authorization code. The backend exchanges that code for access and refresh tokens, stores them server-side in PostgreSQL (never expose tokens to the frontend), and issues a session cookie. Implement auto-refresh when the access token expires. Add a GET /api/me endpoint that proxies Spotify's /me profile data. On the frontend, add a "Sign in with Spotify" button, handle the callback route, and redirect to a profile page showing the user's name and avatar.
