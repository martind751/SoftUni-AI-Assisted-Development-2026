Look at the existing SoundScrAIbe codebase. It's a Go/React + Spotify integration app with auth, profile, listening history, liked songs, artist charts, and track/album/artist detail pages already built. Add a rating system: - Users can rate tracks, albums, and artists on a 1–10 scale from their detail pages - Integrate it into the existing track, album, and artist detail pages - The user has to have sections for "listened", "currently listening", and "want to listen", along with tags, like in Goodreads but for music.
